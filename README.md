# Job-Change-Prediction
A Binary Classification problem where a various ML models were employed to predict if an employee is likely to change the current job.

Analysed the data using Exploratory Data Analysis technique that gave us insights about the data.

This project implements many classification algorithms such as
  1. KNN
  2. Naive Bayes
  3. Decision Tree Classifier
  4. Random Forest Classifier
  5. Artificial Neural Network

The final results were:
Random Forest Classifier performed better with an accuracy of 86%.
